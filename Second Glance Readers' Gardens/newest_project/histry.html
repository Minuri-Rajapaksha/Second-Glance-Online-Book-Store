      					<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
					<p>In 1988 Sri Lanka was a time of economic collapse as it was a time of terror and civil problems. But with a courage a small business started in March 1988. It was named as the ‘Second Glance Book Shop’ and was located at No.08, Puttlam Road, Kurunegala. This place was only 200 Square Feet but was the first step towards a long journey.

					1995 was a better year for us as we expanded our service to a spacious place which was also located in Puttlam Road and was branded as ‘Second Glance Readers' Garden’ this was a landmark for the Creata Group as this place was Air conditioned, Self Service and specialized 90% for its capacity for the printed books.

					1999 we the ‘Second Glance Group’ stepped on to another level. We were able to open a new showroom for Greeting cards which was facing the ‘Second Glance Readers' Garden’ and also on the same year we started importing books from foreign book publishers.

					The year 2003 brought a revolution in to the book publishing culture and Samudra was at the forefront. The company started book publishing specially Work books for English Medium Students RANGING FROM Grade 1 to 12.

					</p>
					
					<p>Firmly established as a major force in publishing and Sri Lankan life, second Glance became a Brand which was on the mouth of every student of the area.
					In 2005 Second glance Book Shop expanded the service to Kandy, establishing a branch in Peradeniya Road.
					Also an Exclusive Shop for Buddhist Publication and CD cassette was opened at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 07, the ‘Borders Book Shop’. This was a unique landmark in Our History.

					2007 we opened another Shop for Colombo residents in Ward Place as the requirement for the books was a developing market in this period of time.

					</p>


					<p>2007 Second Glance Group stepped on to another sector apart from books. It was the education sector. We were able to open a new international school ‘Childrens'Garden College’ for Kindergarten students. This school is facilitated with play areas and a library with the largest collection of children books in the area.

					2008 was a year of achievement as we open a new spacious show room at the heart of Kurunegala City with more than 3000 sq. ft. X 5 Floor Area.Today Second Glance Group is a diversified Brand which provides services in Offset & Digital Printing, Book Publishing, Importing and exporting books, wedding /Greeting cards, plastic name cards and many more sectors.

					From The beginning the ‘Second Glance’ is always looking forward to provide the best quality to its customers.
